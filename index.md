Hi! I'm Aaron, and Iâ€™m currently an Autonomy Engineer at Skydio.  Previously, I was a Master's student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, where I worked in the Search-Based Planning Lab (SBPL).  I'm interested in lots of different aspects of robotics and types of robots, but I've mostly worked on autonomous drones and cars and on tracking and planning.

I got into robotics during my undergrad, where I worked on and co-led a bunch of projects in the Robotics and Automation Society at the University of Pittsburgh.  You can find lots of information on those, and other projects I've worked on since, on my [projects page](/projects).
