Hi! I'm Aaron, and Iâ€™m currently an Autonomy Engineer at Skydio.  I work on Computer Vision and mapping, and I'm the top contributor to [SymForce](https://github.com/symforce-org/symforce), Skydio's open-source library for symbolic math, code generation, and nonlinear optimization for robotics.  Previously, I was a Master's student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, where I worked in the Search-Based Planning Lab (SBPL).  I'm interested in lots of different aspects of robotics and types of robots, but I've mostly worked on autonomous drones and cars and on vision-based pose estimation, tracking, and planning.

I got into robotics during my undergrad, where I worked on and co-led a bunch of projects in the Robotics and Automation Society at the University of Pittsburgh.  You can find lots of information on those, and other projects I've worked on since, on my [projects page](/projects).
